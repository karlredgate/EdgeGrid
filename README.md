# EdgeGrid

Node.js library for signing request to Akamai OPEN APIs.

This follows the style of the standard http and https libraries.

## Install

```
$ npm install karlredgate/EdgeGrid
```

Since this is not currently in the npm package list, you need to
generate explicit package dependencies to use it.

```
{
   ....
   "dependencies": {
      "EdgeGrid": "karlredgate/EdgeGrid"
   }
}
```
